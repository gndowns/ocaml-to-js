# ocaml-to-js
A humble ocaml-to-javascript transpiler I made to study for my [Functional Programming Course](https://www.mcgill.ca/study/2016-2017/courses/comp-302) at McGill

## Usage

Ocaml Lex and Grammar rules are described in `ocaml.jison`, however the actual parser is in `ocaml.js`, automatically generated by [jison](http://zaa.ch/jison/) 

First, install dependencies with:
```
npm install
```

A live interpreter-style transpiler can now be run with:
```
node interpreter.js
```

Type any valid ocaml expression, ending with `;;` and the 'interpreter' will print the javascript equivalent.

### Examples
Simple variable and function assignment examples
```
$ node interpreter.js
# let x = 1;;
var x = 1

# let y = 2.0;;
var y = 2.0

# let add a b = a + b;;
var add = function(a, b) {
  return a + b;
} 

# add x y ;;
add(x, y)
```

## Updating Grammar Rules
*Note* after any changes are made to the grammer in `ocaml.jison` the parser must be re-compiled.
First, install jison with:
```
npm install jison -g
```

Now you can generate the parser with:
```
jison ocaml.jison
```

_this command must always be re-run afer any changes are made to `ocaml.jison`_

`interpreter.js` can now be re-run with the new grammar rules.
